**Project Summary**

This project involved a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a dataset containing Indian Premier League (IPL) match information from 2008 to 2017. The primary objective was to extract meaningful insights, identify key trends, and understand various aspects of match outcomes, team performance, and player contributions.

**Key Phases and Activities**
**Data Acquisition & Initial Inspection:**

The project began by loading the IPL matches dataset, which comprised 636 records and 18 attributes. An initial review provided a high-level understanding of the data structure, column types, and the presence of missing values.

**Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:**

A critical step involved addressing data quality issues. The umpire3 column was identified as entirely null and was noted for potential exclusion. Missing values in city, umpire1, umpire2, and player_of_match were handled through appropriate imputation strategies (e.g., 'Dubai' for the missing city, 'Unknown Umpire', 'No Award'). This ensured a clean and complete dataset for analysis.
